## Description

This website takes a user-inputted word or phrase and removes all the vowels from it. It then displays the altered phrase on a new webpage, inviting users to guess it. The form then takes that submission and informs the user if they have guessed correctly and reveals the initial phrase.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Clone the repository to a machine that has gradle installed, then run it and find the initial page at http://localhost:4567/

## Known Bugs

* The second user's input must exactly match the first user's, with no leeway for capitalization or punctuation differences.
* The first user's input is displayed for all to see in the address bar of the second page.
